## **Wrath and Glory Drag Ruler Integration**

This is a Foundry VTT module for the Wrath and Glory game system that will assist the modules Drag Ruler, Terrain Ruler,
and Enhanced Terrain Layer in colorizing a token's movement range, based on Wrath and Glory's rules.

### **Flight**

If a token is to fly, with Jump Pack or other means of flight, and its elevation is less than or equal to zero, set its
elevation with the token HUD to +1 before starting movement.

This module, while attempting to make gameplay faster, does not enforce any limitation on token movement or action use,
it is simply a visual aid.

If you find any bugs or issues, please post on the project issues forum.
