## **Eclipse Phase 2e Drag Ruler Integration**

This is a Foundry VTT module for the Eclipse Phase 2e game system that will assist the modules Drag Ruler, Terrain Ruler,
and Enhanced Terrain Layer in colorizing a token's movement range, based on Eclipse Phase 2e's rules.

This module, while attempting to make gameplay faster, does not enforce any limitation on token movement or action use,
it is simply a visual aid.
